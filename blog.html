           <h4 class="question">Introduction</h4>
           <p>In today's digital age, online transactions have become the norm for many businesses. One vital component of this process is a hosted payment gateway, such as ZedPe, which facilitates secure and efficient online payments. Understanding the efficiency of a hosted payment gateway is crucial for businesses looking to streamline their payment processing and provide the best online payment solutions to their customers. In this comprehensive analysis, we will delve into the intricacies of payment gateways, the benefits of using a hosted platform like ZedPe, and how businesses can optimise their online payment processes for success.</p>
           <br>

           <h4 class="question">What is a hosted payment gateway?</h4>   
           <p>A hosted payment gateway is a secure online platform that enables businesses to accept online payments seamlessly. When a customer initiates a payment, the transaction data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the gateway for processing. Unlike an integrated payment gateway that requires businesses to handle sensitive payment information directly, a hosted solution like ZedPe ensures that the payment process is outsourced to a third-party provider, reducing security risks and compliance burdens for businesses. By entrusting payment processing to a hosted gateway, businesses can focus on core operations while offering customers a seamless and secure online payment experience.</p>
           <br>
           
           <h4 class="question">Benefits of using a hosted payment gateway</h4>
